# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 26 July 2025

## Overview

This privacy policy explains how the Dive Color Corrector Android application ("the app", "we", "our", or "us") handles user information and data.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be completely transparent: **we do not collect any personal information or data from users of this app.**

Specifically, we do not:
- Collect personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.)
- Track user behavior or app usage
- Gather device information or identifiers
- Use fingerprinting techniques to identify users
- Store any data on external servers
- Access your contacts, location, or other personal data
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Collect crash reports or diagnostic data

## How the App Works

The Dive Color Corrector app processes your photos and videos entirely on your device. All image and video processing happens locally, and no data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.

## Data Storage

- All processed images and videos remain on your device
- The app does not create backups of your media on external servers
- Original files are not modified unless you choose to save the corrected version
- No user preferences or settings are stored remotely

## Permissions

The app only requests permissions necessary for its core functionality:
- **Storage/Media access**: To read and save photos and videos on your device
- No other permissions are requested or used

## Third-Party Services

This app does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our data practices in future versions of the app, we will update this privacy policy and notify users through the app store listing.
